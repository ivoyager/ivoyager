# THIS IS AN EXAMPLE GUI SCENE! It may change in the future. You should
# duplicate this scene or build your own GUI scenes outside of the ivoyager
# directory.
#
# A little code is needed here to allow some (but not too much) overlap between
# PlanetMoonButtons and SSSBsCkbxs if the panel is resized dynamically.
# UnderMoonsSpacer keeps the former from squishing into the bottom of the panel.
