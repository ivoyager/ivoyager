# See Asteroid Importer addon for creation of asteroid binaries. (TODO! It needs update to work with current ivoyager.)									
# Edit mag_cutoff to change how many asteroids are loaded. Number asteroids at mag_cutoff: 15.0 ~94k; 14.0 ~31k, 13.0 ~9k, 12.0 ~3k.									
# All other columns (and provided rows) are used to make binaries and should not be changed unless rebuilding binaries. 									
# Groups are based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_planets#Orbital_groups, with criteria modified so there are no excluded orbits.									
# Asteroids are added to the first matching group. q, perihelion (closest); a, semimajor axis (peri- & apohelion average); q = (1 - e) * a.									
# For each group, binaries were created representing half-integer ranges of magnitude. mag_cutoff determines which of these binaries are loaded.									
# Rows here are currently hard-coded into navigation_panel.gd. This is something we try very hard not to do! To make this procedural rather than									
# hard-coded, we would need columns here telling GUI where the asteroid group should be placed relative to planets.									
# Totals shown in comments are from wiki, and I think include only numbered. We have multiopposition non-numbered, so add ~20%.
